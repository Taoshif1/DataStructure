# DataStructure.C
This repo is about pointers & memory in C language.
Status- WIP (Work in progress)

The objectives of this course are to-
1. introduce an Overview of elementary Data Organization,
2. Introduction of the basic data structures for storing and retrieving ordered or
unordered data using arrays, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, graphs, graph Search
and Traversal Techniques, and hash tables.
3. develop the idea of asymptotic analysis using Big-O techniques to compare different
algorithmic solutions.

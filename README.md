[![Status: Learning Completed (for now!)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Learning%20Completed%20(for%20now!)-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Taoshif1/LearningTS)

Welcome to the **DataStructure** repository — a full-fledged implementation and exploration of core **Data Structures in C**, following the syllabus of **CSE 207: Data Structures**. This repo covers everything from pointers to linked lists, stacks, queues and trees — not just to learn but to master memory-level control and logic building.

## 📘 Course Context

> **Course:** CSE 207 — Data Structures  
> **Language Used:** C (Pointers, Dynamic Memory, Structs)  
> **University:** East West University, Dhaka  
> **Semester:** 4th Semester

## 📂 Implemented Problems & Topics
The repository is organized by topic for clarity and revision, reflecting the hands-on problems solved by myself:

### 🔗 Linked List
- Create three nodes
- Create a Linked List from an Array
- Traverse a Linked List
- Insertion at the End by returning value
- Search an element in a Linked List
- SLL (Original & Reverse)
- DLL (Original & Reverse)
- Traversal of SLL (Iterative Approach)

### 📍Pointers & Memory
- Checking address of elements in array
- Dereferencing a pointer
- Traverse array using dereference operator
- Summation using dereference operator
- Address of nodes
- Playing with pointers pt.1 / pt.2 / pt.3

### 📚 Stack & Queue (Dynamic)
- Dynamic Stack
- Dynamic Queue

### 🌲 Tree
- BST (Binary Search Tree) Implementation
- Count number of Nodes
